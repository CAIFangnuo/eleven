0, February 2021,2,Domestic,Economy,Allegiant Air- Travel is our deal!,"Well travel my be their deal, but “Late” should be their Moto. I have now travelled 8-10 times this past year on this airline and believe I need to look a little bit less at their cost and more on quality. Time is money, and each delay I encounter with this airline cost more than the ticket+cost.  Sorry to say this but until they can get with the rest of the industry and look at their on time rate as a quality issue I think they need to be passed up as a cost effective carrier.  Last trip 7 hour delay, time before 5.5 hours delay and now today while I write this we are already sitting here with a 2.75 hour delay and no details on when we might see an aircraft, much less board.  I can understand if a whole airport has delays at the same time but with Allegiant, every time in the last 9 flights it has only been this airline that had the delays at the airport I was at. As you can see I am flying to Las Vegas but Not as a player or tourist, I have a rental car to pick up to head to Arizona for business. Again, the delays are costing more money than the flight savings.  Sorry team, but time to look at a change and value of time.…",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
1, February 2021,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Nickle and Dime,$50 for a carry on. Let that sink in. The time you're done with all the fees its cheaper in the end using Southwest or Delta. Will never fly with them again.,Allegiant,low-cost,USA
2, January 2021,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Horrible experience,"I will never fly Allegiant again. I am a disabled veteran who has a service dog for whom I have flown with on Allegiant several times in the past. The dog is perfectly behaved, small and has his paperwork, vaccine records, etc. The gate staff was rude and refused my boarding. I guess that's the way they treat those who gave part of their health serving this country!!! Stay away.…",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
3, February 2020,2,Domestic,Economy,Car Rental thru Allegiant then Alamo,"We purchased a car rental when we purchased our flights, which was 6 weeks before our trip.   When we arrived in Sarasota Alamo said Allegiant had overbooked the car rental & they did not have any more cars ( our rental house was 45 minutes away) so my husband went to Avis & they only had 2 cars & we had to have one so we had to pay over$1400 for another car.   Allegiant have use a $298 voucher for future use!!!  They way we see it, we were just out $1100 that we should not have had to spend & Allegiant should be responsible to paying for the car rental since it was their mistake.

6, January 2021,1,Domestic,Economy,$100 Charge for BAG 1 LB OVERWEIGHT (that was 3 lbs UNDER when I weighed it myself),"So, this is not only the least safe airline (per FAA report), they are also the worst at customer service, on time arrivals, and charging $100 for a pound (my home scale showed I was 3 pounds UNDER!) Ground staff usually dismissive and rude. This is the airline built to give the…",Allegiant,low-cost,USA

8, January 2021,5,Domestic,Basic Economy,Satisfied with Allegiant Air,We were pleased with how Allegiant gave us a 1 year voucher immediately when we decided to not take our spring break 2020 trip to Florida.

10, January 2021,1,Domestic,Economy,DO NOT FLY WITH ALLEGIANT!,"This airline is by far one of the worst airlines to use.

16, January 2021,1,Domestic,Economy,Worst Airline Ever,"Every single time I’ve flown Allegiant, it was delayed multiple hours. They have minimal measures in place for covid-19 safety, and they don’t communicate with the passengers until the last minute when there is a delay.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA

21, December 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Nightmare!!! Stay Away!!! Allegiant left their customers stranded!!!,"When our flight was diverted from Boise due to fog, the Allegiant Air pilot was directed to divert the flight right back to the original departed city.  What was really disheartening was the passengers were returned back to the airport and no one provided any type of information for rescheduling our flight, and there were people stranded with no were to go.  How dare you Allegiant treat your customers with disrespect and leave so many passengers with nowhere to go. In the end, you get what you pay for and I will never fly this airline again! We purchased tickets with Delta Airlines the next day and finally made it home.  Thank you Allegiant for stranding your customers and leaving them to figure out what to do. Shame on you!",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
22, December 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Customer Services has turned me off from this company,"Horrible customer service!!! I missed a flight due to longer wait times, and was asked to pay a $75 fee to get on the next flight. No big deal, life happens and I understand the fee. I went to make a phone call to my daughter to let her know what is going on, and was told to step to the side until I finish. Again, no big deal. Get everything together to stay another night. Go back to the counter to pay the fee and get on the next day's flight, guess what!? NO ONE WAS AT THE COUNTER!!! My daughter calls customer service, was on hold for 1:30hr for them to hang up on her because she raised her voice out of frustration. She was told there was no $75 fee, just the difference between the ticket prices and it would cost me $198 for a new ticket. That ticket wasn't even $198 on the website. It was $160. By the time my son in law picked me up from the airport (1hr later) there was still NO ONE at the counter to help me. My daughter ended up using a different airline (and that ticket was only $105) to purchase a ticket to get me home. And to be honest, the overall experience with United, was by far better than this disaster I dealt with.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
23, December 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,A Covid19 nightmare,No distancing! The flight was packed to the brim! If we had another way to get home I never would have boarded this hot covid nightmare. There were no temps taken and masks weren’t being enforced. I will never fly this airline again.,Allegiant,low-cost,USA
24, November 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Nightmare,"The absolute worst travel experience we've ever had. Will not be using Allegiant Air ever again. Delayed flights, cancelled flights, lost our luggage, and the customer service is so awful. No one gives a crap to help, total incompetence!",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
25, December 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Terrible X 10 Employees,"Flew to Nashville, spent weekend - wife took 10"" x 8"" thin purse and bag 14"" x 18"" x4"". On return flight, arrogant, condescending young female (NOT a lady by ANY stretch of decency) told my wife she could not carry 2 items though she flew to Nashville with the same 2 items. Wife was putting purse in bag and  vile employee would not let her put her purse in the bag and offered one solution - check the 14x18x4 bag for $50. As I waited from my wife near plane, flight attendants said there was a lot of room in the overheads so no need to scrimp on space - we had the captain go speak on her behalf - he was a coward and turned and ran when the belligerent yelled. Worst service in my lifetime (63 years) of any airline. DO NOT use Allegiants: employees, captains are not good people.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
26, December 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,COVID not taken seriously,"No temperatures were taken, many people with their nose outside of their masks were not corrected, lots of people eating/drinking on a 2 hr flight.... I used to love allegiant for the price but I do not feel that they take passenger safety seriously. I am done with them.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
27, December 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Never again,Sat on a plane for two hours before they told us the plane wasn’t working. Currently stuck at the airport and none of the staff or pilot know what’s going on. Horrible leadership.,Allegiant,low-cost,USA
28, December 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Awful,"To start, you really aren’t getting a much cheaper fight here. The price may look better than other airlines, but after all the fees, you are only seeing a slight savings over other airlines. A savings that isn’t worth the hassle and poor customer service. Plus, the likelihood of your cost savings being turned into a loss is far greater than on other airlines. Our experience...Our flight was delayed twice before getting an overhead announcement that the flight was being cancelled. I understand things happen, but there was a total disregard for the impact on the passengers. Their solution, either give us a refund credit or reschedule our flight (next flight available to our destination was four days later). The staff didn’t even act like they cared. Scoffed at us as if the other reservation ahead of us weren’t their problem. I blame Allegiant for ruining the surprise trip to Disney for our daughters. I wouldn’t recommend even giving them a chance to ruin your trip. If I have it my way, never again. And I hope this review makes you think twice about choosing them. Just don’t do it. Dear Allegiant,I would have never wrote this review if you would have attempted to make this right with us.  A little effort on your end would have been nice. You’ve cost me hundreds, now I hope this review costs you thousands.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
29, December 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,The worst airline ever,I will never use Allegiant again. They do NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS AT ALL! So due to a previous flight being delayed Allegiant has canceled our flight. The fact that they left us sitting in the airport and the fact that sitting right next to me a person was attacked and taken to the hospital because of stupid people. I feel so sorry for the family and the kids. The employees didn’t even step in until the father was beaten to the point where he had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital! The fact I am missing one of the most important days in my life that cost me thousands of dollars to say I do! No accommodations no help! I am out hotel fees for a hotel I am not using and then to get another one! Not to mention that we have to get a rental car to get to another hotel for the night is just ridiculous! ￼so the employees there telling everyone there is nothing they can do to call Allegiant. Now mind you I waited on hold with customer service for hour and half to be told there is nothing they can do other than refund my money for the flight which is 7-10 days for the refund! So I can’t even get a flight on another airline! This airline is a joke! Thanks for ruining everything Allegiant! If I could give you 0 stars I would!,Allegiant,low-cost,USA
30, February 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Worst. Flight. Ever,"The flight attendants were horribly rude, and didn't give a crap about how the passengers were treated. While i was boarding, one of the attendants yelled at me for not knowing if a stowaway was full or empty (They were ALL closed, so how was i supposed to know?) and proceeded to give me a ""lesson"" about how storage works. I dont give a damn about storage. I just wanted to get to my destination.The seats were awfully uncomfortable and the tray tables could varely fit my phone. Ruined my experience with the flight attendence nagging at me, but thankfully i barely arrived at my destination.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
31, December 2020,2,International,Basic Economy,spam,"I flew Allegiant one time earlier in the year.  Since then I have been bombarded with spam email from them.  I have unsubscribed  numerous times, but it just keeps coming.  Due to this I will not fly with them again.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
32, December 2020,5,Domestic,Basic Economy,very impressed!,"i was nervous to fly with allegant after seeing terrible reviews but their flight was significantly less expensive than everyone else and was a straight flight. very happy with the trip!!  left on time for both flights, they weren't psychotic about masks (they require  them but i kept lowering mine and nothing was said) veey nice staff and clean plane!",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
33, December 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,"Worst airline ever, don't waste your time or money.","I've been delayed a few times with Allegiant in the past, and have only flown with them a few times. This time we get to the desk to check our bags and they say ""did you hear your flight is delayed? Your plane hasn't left it's last destination yet."" So we check our bag which was 48lbs (we made sure it was under 50, which was hard) and they still charged us $50 because we were over their 40lb limit. Of course figured it was just like every other airline that allows 50lbs. Even with our flight being super delayed they wouldn't waive the fee. So we leave our bag with them and go through security to get dinner and wait for our flight. As we're eating we get the notification that our flight has been canceled. We go back to the desk to get our bag and they wouldn't give us a reason why the flight was delayed and also said their computers are slow so we're going to have to call 1-800 to get our refund. The app only gives a refund to credit. They only fly to our destination 2x per week we had to get to our family for early Christmas and for my work. We finally after a few hours end up booking a flight through Southwest, which was more expensive of course than our original flight. We also had to get a hotel that night. When we call 1-800 to get a refund we ask if they'll reimburse us for the extra $400 we had to spend for our flight and hotel and they wouldn't even entertain the idea. WORST AIRLINE EVER. Never using them ever again. I can't believe they're still in business. Do us all a favor Allegiant and shut down your terrible airline services.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
34, December 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Last minute cancelation,"Our flight was canceled the morning it was scheduled with no alternative to anywhere near. We did fly round trip originally from palm springs to Boise was canceled 1 week prior, ended up đriving to Phoenix,AZ to fly out(this although inconvenient was forgivable as it was 1 week prior). But unless related to weather(which this was not) have I ever been canceled same day. The price is not worth the hassle. The bags you pay to be checked maximum weight is 40lbs this too is very inconvenient and is not clearly marked. I had no problems with customer service just reliability. I will never fly with this airline again!",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
35, December 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Terrible customer service,"After standing in line for what is seemed an eternity, what I thought it was a good deal turned out it was as bad as spirit airlines, the same nickel and dime game, the hidden charges and surprises are endless, not not mention lower bag weigh limits, uncomfortable seats, no wifi or entertainment and to top it all off ridiculous expensive snacks on board. I will never flight this airline again, I thought I was saving some money, in the end turned out to be more expensive that any other airline.I strongly recommend you find another airline to give your money to.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
36, October 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Awful Service Awful Airline,The flight line is literal dog crap and i wouldn’t waste my money on it again. Find a different airline if you’re considering this one.,Allegiant,low-cost,USA
37, July 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Flyer Beware!,"My wife and I were preparing to go through the TSA checkpoint in the Springfield-Branson airport, and the operator there indicated that we had to have checked in. We arrived about on hour before our morning flight and there were only a handful of travelers in the Airport. We turned in our rental car and about 45 minutes out there wasn't anyone at the Allegiant counter. I went to pull up the app to check in and it said boarding for the flight was closed. I asked the operator of security to tell them that we had a prepaid return flight on Allegiant and he sent someone who was advised that although they were continuing to board, Allegiant turns off PC access to the flight 45 minutes in advance so we were denied check in and boarding. When I called Allegiant Air and asked for another flight they said I cannot have credit toward another flight. in over 40 years of travel this is the first time that I have experienced an Airline stop checking in passengers 45 minutes from flight departure time, not deny credit toward a later flight. So Flyer buyer beware. As for me, as long as they do not give me credit toward a flight and keep this policy, I will never book a flight via Allegiant Air again.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
38, December 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Horrible,"The fact that no one gives two effs about reviews is what does it for me, if they did they wouldn't have so many bad reviews. This one goes to that nikolet or nicole however you spell your name. Choose a different job, you having a condescending and disgusting attitude shows how much you care about your job. You live and you learn right? luckily it'll be my first and last time flying with them. Absolut TRASH.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
39, December 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,This airline is absolutely Horrible,I fly almost every two or three weeks I go through them EVERY TIME I GO it's a horrible time the employee are very rude and disrespectful the in flight is always good just getting to the plane I'm about ready to just go through another airline i can't take it anymore I don't deserve rude employees to talk to me very disrespectful I'm just tired EVERY TIME there is always a rude employee do not go through this airline,Allegiant,low-cost,USA
40, December 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,DO NOT BUNDLE unless you're prepared to pay,"For the first time, we booked a rental car as part of the bundle package. Paid at the time of booking. When I arrived to pickup my rental car, I was hit with $124 in ADDITIONAL fees. Yes, they say you will be chareged taxes, surcharges, etc, but over $100 is insane. It would have been cheaper to rent the car privately through alamo, budget, or enterprise.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
41, October 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Extra Fees,"Because of COVID-19, many airlines have become more flexible with flight changes and cancellations. In Allegiant's case, they have shown nothing about their customer's well-being, and pack each aircraft. It is astonishing to see how little they care, I have tried to switch my flight for another date, and they refused to switch my date without charging me a $41 fee. The staff there are so friendly, but the way that this company is managed is awful and they only care about the money at the end of the day. 0/10",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
42, April 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Horrible,"Horrible airline.  Paid for seats and did not even get to sit in them on the flight going and flight returning.  38 minutes before boarding everyone receives and email are plan is delayed. Was suppose toBe a direct flight. They sent a plane from Buffalo NY halfway filled already and told us when boarding find a empty seat to sit. What happened to following covid. Policies?  No this was not because a plane broke down, this was to save money since many people are not flying. On the way back from Florida the same thing accrued suppose to have a direct flight. They flew past our airport to go to Buffalo to drop people off the. And hour back to out destination. Again 40 minutes before boarding we find out. Called and called customer service no response back. Absolute crappy customer service. Spend the extra $50 and get a real flight with no hassle.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
43, January 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Credit Voucher worthless,"I booked a flight in December 2019 to Florida for April 2020.  My flight was cancelled by Allegiant.  They gave me a credit voucher with an expiration date of December 2020.  I tried to use the voucher by booking another flight in late November 2020.  When I put the voucher in, for the first time, I was told that it could only be used on travel that was completed by the expiration date.  This voucher was issued in April 2020.  There was not statement indicating that it had to be for travel between April and December 2020.  I have been trying for nearly 5 days to reach Allegiant.  I sent an email 5 days ago with no response as of now.  I have called the phone number and been on hold for nearly 45 minutes before I had to hang up because I can't spend all day on hold.  I have tried their chat function but am always greeted with ""No agent is available"".  I attempt to call and chat with them 2x/day.  Nothing.  I am very concerned that I will loose my $ and I didn't even cancel the flight, Allegiant did.  I see a consumer protection complaint in my future if I don't reach them and get this rectified.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
44, November 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Horrible Customer Service  and Care,"Cancelled flights and LONG waits! As a courtesy for their own mistakes, we received 2 $50 vouchers. However, due to COVID-19, those vouchers had to be extended which, I had to FIGHT for taking several hours of my personal time and MUCH headache! No one should ever have to fight to use vouchers which were a courtesy for their own mistakes!! Ridiculous. I would rather pay the full price then deal with this POOR customer service and skip the stress and headache. On top of that, the plane was filthy and uncomfortable! They didn't even take the time between flights to clean. Not flying with this airline again!",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
45, November 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Worst airline ever,"I’ve flown with allegiant airlines multiple times and this was the by far the worst, I will not be flying with the allegiant ever again..They will find ways to charge you for anything on luggage",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
46, November 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,I paid for seats and we were separated during pandemic,"I want a refund on my seats that I purchased. Not only was I forced to sit somewhere else, I was separated from my children AND sat next to strangers which Increased my risk for getting COVID! I paid for seats and I never got to sit in them and sat next to some guy coughing and sneezing. I PAID FOR SEATS!!! My children were all separated from each other and also were exposed to strangers! I paid $20 per seat so we could be together and in the front  row so we could have less exposure to possibly infected people and not walk past people in isles. You lost my business and my families business forever! Even if you had a free flight,  I wouldn’t take it! if I have to pay for sears that I were taken. Oh and then on top of that, you added a stop to a non stop flight! During a pandemic,, with no informed consent. I flew non stop so we’d would have one plane full of passengers ,  not two, .which doubled our exposure to passengers. The stop deplaned most of the passengers and then a you filled the plane with new passengers. Statistically added the number of passengers infected with the virus which is certain someone had it in a population of 200 during a 3rd wave.  If Each of us were able to sit with our household members because I PAID for the seats then it would have been safer.  Pretty simple concept that when you pay for seats, you are able to sit in them. The flight attendants did NOT enforce the masks rule either.  I want someone to contact me about making a purchase and never getting what I paid for and being forced to sit I random seats, separated during a pandemic. I paid and not only got nothing but also eliminated my attempt to mitigate the Covid risks for all three of us.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
47, November 2020,5,Domestic,Economy,Very Pleasant Flight Attendant,Busy holiday weekend.  Lourdes (Lulu) was very friendly and welcoming.  Helped me store my heavy luggage.  I use Allegiant often and appreciate staff like Lourdes!  Thank you!,Allegiant,low-cost,USA
48, October 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,DO NOT FLY WITH ALLEGIANT,"This airline is by far the worst airline. The first time I flew with them flight delayed for over 4 hours. I decided to give them one more chance. I was to fly from St. Pete to Memphis. I flew from Memphis to St. Pete to even get there. Same carry on bag and same personal item. However, when I was boarding the plane the flight attendant told me that I would have to check in my carry on because it didn’t fit the dimensions. No big deal. Sure, I’ll check it in. I told her I needed to find my card. She said I had 2 mins. I’m looking for my card and she’s pretty much going ahead to close the door. She had no intentions on giving me time to find it and proceeded to close the door. I didn’t make a fuss about it at the gate but I proceeded to go to customer service to rebook. The lady FOLLOWS me to the counter to harass me. I was dealing with one guy and she had him move out of the way so she can come harass me. I wish I could make this up. She proceeds to tell me that there’s not a flight until Monday or there’s a flight to Knoxville I can take tomorrow. (Knoxville is 6 hours away from my destination). And proceeds to tell me I will have to pay $75. I was not going to stand there and be harassed and sooo asked the male agent who originally was standing there if there was a customer service line I could call. Then I left. Called the customer service line. Was on hold for 30 mins before getting an agent to tell me there’s nothing he can do either (apparently harassment lady made notes he was reading that were not even remotely close to what ACTUALLY happened). And so I asked to speak to a manager. I was like you can watch the cameras and see what actually happened because I never yelled, cussed at anyone or even got out of character for this lady. Who has time for all of that honestly. Customer service proceeded to tell me they have no managers on site and that I would have to go to their website and press “contact us” and they will get back to me within 4-6 WEEKS  in order of email. Lol OKAY 👌🏽 great. Also the customer service agent offered to rebook me a flight from Fort Lauderdale at 3:00 pm (😆😂) note when I got an agent on the phone it was 3:12 pm already. I’m like so you’re offering to rebook me on a flight that has already left. He’s like well I don’t know what time zone you’re calling me from... ohhh but you asked for my ticket information that already told you where I was located to get my flight rebooked. Needless to say, customer service also was no help. I either had to leave on Monday (which was their next flight to my destination) or else I forfeit my funds for that flight. Also they were still making me pay a $75 change fee despite it not being a cancellation or no show as their policy states in their terms or conditions. I needed to leave sooner than Monday sooooo I booked a flight with my favorite airline Southwest. They literally have the best customer service. The best gate agents. Flight attendants. And I travel a lot in general and this was probably the worst customer service all around as a company. You call allegiant customer service and it says they have waived all change flight fees etc as the wait time “music” and here you are trying to charge me a change flight fee. Like WHAT? For a flight I can’t even take. That was at the point I realized talking to him and everyone else was a lost cause with this company. Never met such terrible customer service in all my life. Just going to call that flight a loss of money and they gave me a voucher for my checked bag soooo if anyone wants it happy to give it to you!!! I wIll not fly with this airline again unless I’m desperate desperate.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
49, November 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,If I could give them no filled in bubbles..they would get nada.,"OMG avoid like the plague, the most foul mouthed flight attendants you will ever encounter. The plane has so many safety issues and its dirty. The plane was disgusting. I overheard one flight attendant tell a passenger that if she asked to use the bathroom one more time they would throw her off the plane. If that was me I would have took it to the top.My friends and family know of my situation and they promised me they would tell their friends not to fly either. Spread the word...The positive reviews are fake as hell too. they gotta be. Don't believe me. Buy the ticket take the ride.PS there is no tray table. You will see what I am saying if you fly. lol Enjoy.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA

Wasn't raining in Cincinnati or St. Petersburg, nor were there any storms.  Did not offer any vouchers for the long wait.  All they offered was ""free water"" on the aircraft, all for a 5 hours wait.  If you want to buy a soda on the plane, it is $3, and they fill the cup full of ice.  Departure desk person spoke so fast, you couldn't understand her when she made announcements.  I will NEVER fly this airline again.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
51, November 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Jerk Gate agent,the gate agent was super rude i had two bags that i combined and it was just 3 inches taller and they wouldn't allow it I ended up getting it 3 inches smaller and they said it was too wide now the entire time speaking in condescending tones i didnt reply back and he kept talking i ended up paying 50$ for my bag after him saying told you And the best part is getting on the plane and there were plenty of Empty seats all over and I had to pay for it  what a joke,Allegiant,low-cost,USA
52, November 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Bad Trip,This was the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. The flight going was uneventful the seats were smaller but I felt for the price that was a small setback. The check in returning to Memphis was disappointing and truamatic. The check in people were ride and unhelpful. There were three of us and one got to the airport an hour and a half early...the other two got there at 40 minutes prior to take off due to unforeseen circumstances. In essence we were told it would take to long to board..so we could be book two days later and add $75 per person. We asked if they could assist us in finding another flight in another airline they advised that they could not do that and the two day delay and extra money was it and all five of them turned and started playing around laughing and left us at the counter. They did not show compassion nor people skills. We went to American airlines and we're treated like true customers. Although we had to pay an extra $400 and stayed the night at the airport we were content. The leg room was better and the luggage policy was alot better. I will never fly Allegient again no matter how inexpensive they are.,Allegiant,low-cost,USA
53, November 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,THE ABSOLUTE WORST,"The customer service is horrendous. So rude, so unhelpful..in fact the opposite. Will go out of their  way to Give you a hard time just because. Miserable staff who hate their job and life in general. If you want to miss your flight, lose luggage, have to check unnecessary stuff( just to charge you) or simply have your day or possibly even your whole trip ruined then go here. Oh, and no refunds for suffering their hell, dispute it with your bank I wouldn't give them a dime by choice ever again I'd rather shave my head with a butterknife. If you thought checking your bag was the end of them inflicting misery on you, just wait for the flight to recieve the worst treatment you've ever endured, and with a nasty attitude. Youd be lucky to see your luggage on that belt after you land, that would be the holy grail of your suffering. You will undoubtedly regret flying with this airline.

55, November 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Terrible customer service,Our flight was delayed 10 hrs causing us to lose a whole day of vacation. We had to pay for an rv that we reserved because we had basically 2 hrs notice about the delay and the rv place was closed by the time we got there. We had to rush to find a hotel at the last minute therefore spending more money that we hadn't planned on spending. The airline has advised that there will not be any compensation. I am beyond angry and disappointed in their terrible customer service and lack of empathy for the passengers of this flight. Unacceptable,Allegiant,low-cost,USA

This was a special race during Covid-19 times.  All precautions were being taken, therefore the entry fees weren't cheap.  Absolutely devistating on all levels.  I got an automated call from Allegiant, ""Sorry for the inconvenience, hope you'll fly with us again"".  Allegiant should make a personal effort to make things right or at least better!

I found it appalling that I nor any other passenger was ever asked at ticketing or at the gate if they had any symptoms, had been near anyone with Covid etc. Nothing came to me on an email when I checked in as well. There was no social distancing on the flight and I was seated in between two other passengers.

59, November 2020,5,Domestic,Economy,Excellent Experience during COVID,"We have flown with Allegiant several times over many years and our experiences have ranged from pretty poor to excellent. Over the last two years our experiences have been pretty good to great. Most recently we booked a flight from St. Petersburg, Florida to Greenville, South Carolina and it was an excellent experience - even with the additional concern of COVID.They altered the boarding process and boarded from the back of the plane to the front of the plane. After all of the passengers were on the plane the flight attendants moved passengers around to increase social distancing. Basically if there was a full row of passengers who were not all traveling together they would move a passenger so the middle seat could be open.We felt like the crew did a great job of trying to promote social distancing and we never felt crowded on the plane. We know this can only happen on flights that are not full but we did appreciate the crews effort to make the flight go smoothly and wanted to recognize the excellent flight experience.The flight went quick and we landed 20 minutes early. If you are interested in our experience flying during COVID on Allegiant we did create a video about it on our YT Channel. The link is in our bio, or you can search ""Explorcation"" in YT.Happy trip planning!",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
60, November 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Covid 19 exposure,"Please be advised that if you care about safe travel during Covid 19 Do Not Fly on Allegiant Airlines.  We flew from Memphis Tn to St. Petersburg Fl and paid for seats leaving the middle seat open.  Soon as we boarded we seen that Allegiant had filled the Middle Seat even though there were other empty seats on the plane.  Then we noticed that flight attendant TY was wearing a mask down below her nose which defeated the purpose of a mask in violation of company policy.  Then we looked across the aisle and there were two male passengers who totally had taken off their masks in violation of airline policy and promises (BROKEN) for sure.  There also was other passengers not wearing masks.  The whole situation was terrible and for the flight attendants who seen the people not wearing masks and said NOTHING, they should be disciplined and the one TY who did not wear a mask properly should be dismissed.  The airline promised continuously through E-Mails that they were safe and everyone had to wear masks, they would try to leave middle seats open, employees would make sure everything was done correctly and they became the worst offenders.  Wrote to Allegiant and received no satisfaction except the normal generic reply.  Nothing about anything being done about any of the situations sited.  Allegiant Airlines has lost us as customers and if you are smart and do not want to expose yourself to people who do not care about you contacting Covid 19 Do Not travel on Allegiant Airlines.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA

Then coming back made me change my mask to one of theirs and said I had to wear it the entire trip, however..... half way through the flight the flight attendant, sitting 2 inches away from another flight attendant took his mask off for the rest of the flight as he was sneezing the entire time.

Needless to say the same girl that checked our bags in then proceeded to come up to the boarding area , apparently she runs the whole show where again she was RUDE to multiple people and holding up the line to have people place their personal item into their makeshift sizing area to make sure NOTHING was sticking out of any corners or guess what ? Yep that will be 50.00 .....I mean their making a fortune off luggage alone so no wonder they advertise low flight fares !!! A 120 flight will one way or another run you about 250 that’s after you pay for your 40 pound suitcase ( 99% of other airlines is 50 pounds and don’t even think about being even .5 ounces over or guess what ? Yep you got it that’s 50- 100 more ) pick your seats , pay for extra personal item and if your lucky a in flight coke for about 8 dollars !!

No explanation. Just canceled. What a joke.

I think I'll be crippled from this flight. The amount of nickle and diming they do makes paying a little extra for a better airline worth it.  $40 to check a bag $50 to carry on. $5 for a boarding pass, $ to pick your seat, etc. Every other flight I've been on the bag weight limit is 50lbs.

I had made a screen shot of it and he said it was a fake boarding pass. And also said my medical service dog was not a service dog.  He said he was calling the police and have me arrested because my boarding pass was fake.  Funny how it worked at security with TSAI said my bag is on that plane with my medicine and he said too bad.  So I turned around to go to another airport and get on another airline.  He blocked my way to the door and said I was not allowed to leave until the police got there and told security to lock the doors.  Of course the plane left without me and my bag. The police said he was crazy that he could not arrest me.  anyone who flies this airline is stupid - This is the 2nd time I got hassled for my service dog on this airline.

78, October 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Very Disappointed,I thought that the airlines were taking safety precautions because of the rona.  WRONG!!  The plane was packed and over half of the the passengers had no mask on. What's up with that?! The airline staff made no attempt to enforce the face mask mandate.

I always fly Delta, but since I'll be traveling more to see my grandson I decided to save money. 1st I love that I flew out from a small airport. No big crowds like at orlando mco. 2nd I made sure I hade a mask but they will give you one. We had no problems with people wearing their mask. I knew the seats were smaller, but for a cheap airline I expected that. You can buy snacks before you board if you just have to have snacks. If not they do sale items. Had a rough landing in indy but it was really windy. Smooth flight otherwise. If you download app your bags are cheaper, so do that instead of paying at airport. For a cheap flight not bad!",Allegiant,low-cost,USA

Not only was the flight delayed, but the flight didn’t leave until almost 8pm and it was scheduled to leave at 7:05 pm. The flight was full, all seats filled. They served snacks and beverages and I noticed the flight attendant didn’t change his gloves in between credit/debit card transactions and serving drinks, which I thought was disgusting. The lavatory wasn’t cleaned when we stopped in Orlando either. I’ll never fly with Allegiant again.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
81, October 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Just do the flight,"The flight was well. The coordination for the rental car was terrible. We booked a rental car through allegiant because they said make life easier this way. Prepaid for it. And although the flight was on time getting in, there was no one there for us to pickup a car. This happened to 4 other customers on the plane. And Allegiant's lack of care that they left people stranded at the airport was astonishing. There needed to be some kind of communication out to those that booked cars that we would need to change our reservations prior to getting on our flights. They offered no sign of solution. We went to the only other rental car company open and the only options they had left were luxury cars for $340 a night. To take an uber to where we were going was going to xost 150 one way and another 150 to get back. We ended up having to cancel our hotel room where we we're headed and staying a night near the airport so that we could pick up the car the next day. Both Alamo and Allegiant blamed the other and not once offered a way to make it right. I wouldn't recommend someone to fly with them. It's not worth the headache to pay a lower price for the ticket. We've never been treated so horrobly by an airline.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
82, October 2020,3,Domestic,Economy,A COVID 19 melting pot,"This was my first time flying since the COVID outbreak. I was nervous but was told most airlines were taking extra precautions. Well I now know MOST are, but not Allegiant. My flight was delayed so the waiting area was jam packed. I know they can not control this, but this made the atmosphere chaotic and stressful from the beginning (not to mention the lack of mask wearing). As they began boarding the plane, no social distancing measures were enforced, everyone was packed by the door waiting to get on. Once on the plane, I figured the mask policy would be enforced a bit better. I was wrong. The workers/ flight attendants did not seem tp care that at least 1/2 of the passengers did not have a mask covering their nose and others had them off their face entirely. They offered food and beverage, which was a surprise to me. The woman next to me got a drink and chips, took her mask off and ate/drank the whole flight.

84, October 2020,2,Domestic,Basic Economy,Combining Flights,"The flight from Sanford, FL to Moline, IL was combined, with no advance notice, with a flight from Fort Wayne, In. How is it possible that they advertise, and I pay for, a direct flight and then they change the terms of our agreement and accept no responsibility for the delays? Not to mention the increased risk of additional people getting on and off the airplane at an additional airport. When I contacted customer service, they advised me I could sign up for alerts to be notified when my flight was at 65% capacity and then choose a different flight from their limited flight days/times. Capacity is not my issue. They offered a direct flight for a set price. I paid their price expecting to get what I paid for. They refuse to credit me or to even acknowledge my concerns about increased health and safety risks. Additionally, they refused to provide the contact information of a supervisor so I could discuss my concerns. In the future, I will seriously weigh any “potential” cost savings against unpredictable flight plans, limited day and time departures, increased health and safety risks, and inferior customer support.

BUT this was a never ending dumpster fire lol flight there was not bad besides already having a 3 hr delay, but was given enough time to adjust. The way home however...we started with 5 in a row delays. They combined flights- which then added in a layover which we all purchased round trip fairs. Over booked by 7 seats which they then said ""if there is anyone here that would like to stay an extra day and volunteer up there seat, we won't charge for ticket changes"" lol how kind to wave the fee of flight change when you're offering to be kicked off your paid ticket. Took over an hour to board bc the attendants just said to find an open seat (idk why we had to pay to pick our seat just for that to be irrelevant)  THEN de-planed bc they were over on weight. Another few delays later- we're finally off to our layover 30 minute flight. We arrived! Except another plane was then at our gate so we waited on the tarmac for 45 minutes, which included more delays after we picked up our other passengers. No one would update us while we sat there for another 30 minutes on what else was going on.

Once bevarge/snack service started, by about row 11 they were out of almost everything, including a much needed adult beverage at this point lol.

We boarded the plane and Allegiant had filled the middle seat which started things off bad as other rows had seats empty.  Next the Flight Attendant (TY) was the name tag and she was wearing her mask down below her nose in violation of stated Allegiant Airline policy that all passengers wear a mask covering their Nose and Mouth.  She continued throughout the entire flight to wear her mask that way and should be dismissed for blatant disregard of company policy as well as putting passengers health at risk.  Next we looked over at the seats across from us 7E & 7F.  Two male passengers were sitting there with NO masks on at all and that continued throughout the entire flight.  The other Flight Attendants stood in the front of the plane talking rather than doing their jobs and going down the aisles to ensure that everyone was wearing a mask as required by the airlines.  One can only believe that since they saw the two male passengers Not wearing Masks that others also were allowed to participate in the same behavior without being told to wear their masks.  This is not only a disgrace but Allegiant should be ashamed of themselves and their Flight Attendants who should be disciplined for putting passengers Health and Lives in danger because of their actions.  I would never take the chance during this Covid-19 Pandemic to Fly on Allegiant Airlines again and if you are smart you won't either.,Allegiant,low-cost,USA
91, October 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,No customer service,"Party of four traveling to Asheville NC for a week long vacation. We arrived to airport 55 minutes before flight was to take off.  Keep in mind this is a regional small airport, there was no one in the airport.  Three of us were dropped off at the ticket counter while the fourth went to park the car.  The three of us stood together in front of the ticket counter where there were 4 employees from Airline were standing- at no point did any of them ask where we were flying ( again no other people inline or waiting other than my party). Once our driver arrived after parking car we went to be ticket counter. Once we approached they asked where we were traveling too? We replied Asheville- I lady who appeared to be a supervisor said that flight was closed- we all thought she was joking.  She was not joking, she said that we needed to be there 45 minutes before flight departs.  It was now 40 minutes before flight was to depart.   We asked if there was any exceptions and supervisor gave a firm no.  I’m a reasonable person and understand rules.. the things that I can’t understand are three of our party were standing at ticket area well before the 45 minute cut off - no one else there except airline employees and know one had the courtesy to say hey we need to get you checked in, second the manor that we were told the flight was closed was done in a smart ass manor when we were first told we actually thought they were joking and finally people choose the small regional airports to avoid the mad rush of large airports with the hopes that they will be treated less like cattle and more like a person.  Apparently Allegiant customer service counter has not received that training.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
92, October 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Horrible customer service,I have flown on this airline multiple times and this will be my last. The bag I have flown with multiple times a year for 10 years got taken and stopped and had to pay an additional fee on top of what I already paid for my carry-on bag. On the way to Nashville my bag was fine as it has been multiple times.

94, October 2020,2,Domestic,Basic Economy,Car rental discount is a joke,"I booked my flight through Allegiant and then received an email stating I could save 20% by booking my rental car through them.  I fell for it.   Big mistake.  You think  what you pay, car rental and Taxes and Fees, is your total.  But wait, when you get to the rental company you still owe $71 Taxes and Fees.  In talking to the customer service chat agent she pointed out it is listed in the teeny tiny print at the bottom of their web page that you will have to pay taxes and fees at the car rental agency.  She is right it does, BUT she could not then tell me what the Taxes and Fees they charged me covered.  Unfortunately, I was not provided a breakdown. Lesson learned, one must not assume.  Do not book through Allegiant for car rental. It was not a savings, and would have been cheaper just going through one the rental car agencies.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
95, October 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,NOT WORTH IT,"Our first flight with Allegiant was in Florida.  They announced just 45 minutes before our flight that the plane was leaving to go somewhere else and we would sit 9 hours.  They offered each passenger a $50 voucher.  This flight we are using the voucher.  We paid a total of somewhere around $500 for the 2 flights and used a total of $100 in vouchers.  After booking, we canceled our checked luggage.  We were told we would get a credit but none came. It turns out if you use a voucher of any amount for a flight, you never get a refund at all.  So, they took our checked bags off and kept our $70.  We get no refund and no checked bag.  This airline is crooked and I wouldn't ever trust them again.  NOT WORTH IT.  Fly someone reputable.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA

Yep! 5 times on day one, then rescheduled to the next day and delayed another 2 1/2 hours, set to leave at 5:09 pm October 2. We had to get hotel rooms, lost a vehicle, lost our condo fees, lost tickets for a boat ride we were to take, only to be told “we refunded your money since you didn’t take the flight” and that is all we will do! We didn’t take the flight because we had spent two full days of a 4 day getaway waiting to see if they were even going to take off after the 7th delay! I would not recommend flying Allegiant at all!

I fly 3 times a month for the past 5 years with numerous airlines and this is the only airline I actually felt unsafe on!!!!

99, September 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,If I could give 0 stars I would!,"I was traveling with my daughter to Florida for a wedding. Everything was great going, coming back however was a major issue. Our flight was delayed 1 hour initially. That didn't inconvenience me because I was notified hours beforehand. We got to the airport around 7:45pm for a 10:15pm flight. At about 10:30pm we were notified that the plane would be delayed again until 10:50, then a notification came immediately afterwards saying the flight was delayed until 1:45am. The entire airport was shut down, including TSA. What's the issue? Surely it was known that the flight would be delayed BEFORE 15 minutes AFTER the 2nd delay time. I completely understand things happen, but no explanation was given about anything and we're stuck in this airport.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
100, September 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Potential COVID HOT SPOT,"FAILURE OF ALLEGIANT for not enforcing mask policies. Almost all people sitting around me wore their masks below their noses and about 4 took their masks down to the chin for 30 mins or more. One passenger sipped on a beer for 55 minutes while he kept it pulled below his chin. When I asked afterwards in the terminal why he didn’t wear the mask properly, it was made clear that he had used the beer and food as an excuse for his hour. Allegiant seems most interested in selling alcohol and food than cleaning up and enforcing mask policies. It spent more time promoting vacation packages and partner deals over the system than health protocols on a completely packed flight. I spoke to the flight crew when disembarking and they seemed indifferent. I’d rather fly a connecting flight on Delta (or AA) than fly direct on Allegiant if this is not changed. There is a VAST difference in policy on those. I’m not even addressing that the flight was over an hour late and the air on the plan at the gate and taxiing was stagnant.... I used to fly Allegiant regularly before cvd, IMO they should be 2 steps ahead in providing confidence, something as simple as mask use is a no-brainer. I submitted online to Customer Service - will they reply by email or a call and restore my confidence? Then I’d consider trying another flight and updating my post.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
101, September 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,"HORRIBLE, worst airline ever","HORRIBLE, spend the money on another airline and avoid this company.  If I could give less than 1 star I would. We had tickets to fly direct to Newark (EWR), and 20 minutes prior to boarding they made an announcement that they were combining our flight with another flight that was going to Boston, and that we would be stopping in Boston first, letting people off and new people board, then going on to EWR. This tripled our travel time, created a layover in Boston, and increased our risk to exposure to COVID. Oh and the seats you purchase are also no longer valid because they do open seating when they combine flights. So if you paid extra for seats in an attempt to social distance from other travelers you won't be getting those. Allegiant says they are doing everything to keep travelers safe, but that's a blatant lie. They would rather PACK one plane and endanger travelers, than fly two partial planes to their designated destinations..The very least they could do is give you the courtesty of a notification ahead of time that they plan to combine flights and stop in another city, so you can cancel or change your travel plans. They tell you 20 minutes before the flight so you are left with no choices. Absolutely horrible. Allegiant is the Uber ride share of the sky. If you don't care about how long your trip is or where your flight is actually going, then Allegiant is for you.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
102, September 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Worst part of wedding experience,"So I was told alligent was nice way to fly to vegas since Sioux  Falls was a hub. So when I got on the plane the horror started! The seats were dirty and something sticky on my arm chair.  Once we got in the air I realized my chair didn’t recline, the tray table was tiny, and there was NO WIFI. So as I sit there with all the people getting drunk on the plane who were yelling and screaming and punching the flight attendants butt (who was I guess ok with it) were annoying. NOONE WAS WEARING MASKS around me and the flight attendants didn’t seem to care. My husband got up and walked to front of plane to go to the bathroom and was told he had to go to the back. He came back to seat due to back one in use and as soon as he buckled in a man entered the bathroom my husband was refused to use. So as we landed the pilot stated that they would dismiss by rows once landed. That surely didn’t happen. Once we landed we weren’t all the way stopped and ppl got up and bumrushed the front. Being I was towards the front of the plane I wasn’t able to get out until towards the last group. As I was walking off the flight attendants were picking up trash and one just crossed right in front of me like o wasn’t there stepping on my toes and all she said was whoops I’m trying to get this side! No apologies or acknowledgement that she just ran into me and stepped on my foot so she could get trash on other side. So the flight back home was no better. Once again I got on a plane that was dirty something on my tray and the back of the seat in front of me had dirt and grime on it and it was disgusting. There was a guy and his gf sitting across fromIs and he was sneezing, coughing, and blowing his nose the whole trip and guess what neither wore a mask. The flight attendants didn’t say a word to them they walked by multiple times and even talked to them. The girl even went all the way to the bathroom without one and nada. I heard the guy laughing and said I’m not wearing mine they don’t care. Well I did!!! I was told it was mandatory but I guess y’all don’t care. The sad part was they woke a man up in back of plane bc his mask slide off his nose and they wanted him to reput it on. The guy and the girl did put them on in airport tho but when your confined on a plane with circulation air pretty much rather you wear there. I just didn’t like the experience at all and will stick with American!!!",Allegiant,low-cost,USA

Covid travel rules said that there was going to be social distancing on the plane (no person sitting in the middle seat) but that was not the case. The whole plane was full, which is extremely unsafe for everyone considering the cases were so high in CA. Also, I ordered the window seat, but then was told I was in the whole seat. I sat in the middle and I am a pretty small person, and I was touching each person next to me. If you are over 5'5, you will not be able to sit comfortably. The legroom was horrible. I have long legs and I was so uncomfortable. The flight attendants were rude and not helpful.

111, September 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Combat veteran discrimination,"I had a traumatizing experience with this airline Friday, September 11th, 2020. I am a combat veteran who has flown with this airline every other weekend for over a year to maintain a long distance relationship with another combat veteran. I feel I was targeted and was a victim of discrimination. Here is my story. Yesterday started out just like any other day. My knee felt better after an injury and nanuk, my French bulldog, and I were headed to Belleville, Illinois to see my boyfriend. I got the kids ice cream, my employee came to stay the weekend like always, I got to the airport early and Nanuk and I took some fun pics. I checked in online, went through security, went to the gate to make sure boarding was at the same time as on the boarding pass and went to the bathroom to let nanuk have time to relax and put on some makeup (I always do this at the airport to save time at home). All of a sudden a woman came into the bathroom saying, “does anyone need assistance in here??” She said it a few times and the bathroom had been toooootally silent so to break the awkwardness I said, “well I could use a million dollars..” and everyone started laughing. A few minutes later she came back, came over to me and said, “I know you’ve been in here throwing up so I want to make sure you’re okay.” I was standing there putting on mascara with black eyeliner and lipstick and perfectly curled hair and i said, “no definitely not, I’m just letting my frenchie breathe and putting on some makeup.” She kept saying, “you’re throwing up I need to make sure you’re okay to fly.” I kept saying, “I promise I’m fine. I haven’t thrown up. There haven’t been any sounds in here at all actually.. nothing happened.” Then she went away. I went to the gate and sat down as usual. I went to the SBA website and got some templates for business plans. I texted my kids and called my boyfriend. I went to board like always, scanned my boarding pass as always, and heard someone whisper, “that’s her. The one with the dog. Pull her aside.” I was thinking ok they’re gonna put me in an exit row because of nanuk. I said, “hey is it because of him? I just use the military free pet carry on you guys have when I fly.” The woman who had been in the bathroom said, “no that’s okay. Medical has to clear you because you’ve been throwing up.” I said, “wait a minute - I wasn’t. I toldYou I wasn’t. I was standing there in the bathroom talking to you and you saw that I wasn’t. I’m okay.” She insisted I couldn’t board, pretended to make a phone call to “medical” about me (no one spoke back to her on said phone call), made me stand there for 30 minutes and then said “yeah no you can’t go. You’re throwing up.” They closed the gates. I said “please guys come on. I never threw up. I was doing makeup. I was letting my dog breathe. Can I please just get on the plane. I’m a veteran, I fly with you every other weekend, I’ve done so for over a year now, please just let me go.” She smirked and said, “you’re a liar. There is no way you’re getting on this plane.” She seemed to get angry, stormed off and then I left after being threatened with police for being argumentative. Honestly... I have never felt so awful in my life. To be accused of something so bizarre, not believed, called a liar, refused entry onto an aircraft...It truly felt like pure discrimination. Truly, profoundly, complete and utter discrimination. I don’t know if it was because of the “blue lives matter” thing that had just happened on delta and I was a military passenger or because I’m thin and therefore must be bulemic or because of the color of my skin... but it felt evil. She was so rude, snide, hateful and disrespectful.. like she was enjoying her power to be cruel to another human. I woke up today with my head spinning and I can’t come to terms with it. It feels like it never could have happened in real life.. but it did. I guess all I can say is.. don’t discriminate. Not to anyone for any reason. Not because of their past or profession.. not because of their weight... not because of the color of their skin. It feels SO TERRIBLE to be a target of that. Like... why? How? Why is everyone against me? Why am I standing here alone being accused of being bad when I’m not?? I did nothing wrong?? Why? I missed my flight obviously and they had no others going out this weekend.Allegiant Airlines: you should be ashamed to have had an employee act that way. You claim to be so supportive of our veterans. As a veteran who has flown loyally with your airline every other weekend for over a year, I am mortified by the actions of your staff. This is something I will never forget. This will impact my life permanently with aversions to making any sort of travel plans.

112, August 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Terrible service & quality and price is a scam,"Be careful. They actually have very small size requirements for carryon so you might end up being shocked and paying an additional fee when you're about to board your flight. (You pay might pay an additional $20 for it to be checked in)Also, normal airlines would not LEAVE their front check-in area 40 minutes before take-off. I could not check-in for a ticket(i had no bags to check and my iPhone was broken so I didn't have a digital ticket) when my flight was at 1:45pm and I was there 12:50pm, and I was forced to repurchase a whole new flight for the next week. Luckily, I was able to cancel the flight, sadly, at 1:00pm while they did not even board yet, and cancel the flight for a voucher. PLEASE note that cancellation and a voucher to purchase a new flight is cheaper than the $75 flight change. ALSO, THEY DID NOT PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING ON my new flight. Only until everyone already sat really close together and we were about to take off they moved one person around. Regardless, I was still sitting very close to people. I recommend delta.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA

It's an article by 60 mins titled ""One mile at a time."" On 07/28/20 I was advised my father was terminally ill and I booked a flight with Allegiant to fly out on the 31st with my family and service dog (SD). We made our flight without any problems. We returned home on 08/14/20, after my father passed, only to take care of some business that needed my personal attention. When I boarded on both days I was never asked for any documentations for my SD. He was wearing a vest clearly marked as a SD. We had to return for my father's funeral on 08/21 and scheduled a flight with Allegiant. We arrived on time, but this time they requested documentations for my SD's health and shot records. Obviously I didn't have them since they never asked for it on my two previous flights. They asked what tasked is he trained for (per the Americans w/ Disability Act any business can ask two questions. Is the dog an SD and what task does he perform). I told them, but they began to ask personal questions against Hippa about symptoms the dog assist me. We explained what the ADA allows them to ask. Sylvia was the ""manager"" who then came out to assist us. We explained how we previously flew on the 31st and the 14th and no one asked for documents for my SD. They verified it, but they still refused to let us board. I explained we were flying to PA for my father's funeral. I tried to show the Obituary with the funeral info, but Sylvia wouldn't even look at it. I went online to see who else I could speak to and found a site stating if someone has a problem they can request to speak to a CRO (customer resolution officer). I asked to speak to one and Sylvia stated they were all CRO's behind the counter. We asked for Sylvia last name but she refused to provide it. Long story short, I missed my father's funeral. How does one get that back? After this incident I began to research Allegiant and found the above listed link. On the 14th as we were returning and preparing to land, it felt like the plane was going to drop out of the sky. I've been flying for many years and have never experienced a landing like this.

All passengers and crew were required to wear masks at all times.  I did not see one crew member or any passenger not wearing a mask.  In fact, each passenger was given a packet with mask, gloves, and antibacterial wipes prior to our flight.  Hepa filters recycled air every 3 minutes and the plane was obviously cleaned in between flights.  That aside, our flight was a good experience.  Plenty of communication from crew and pilots, and a smooth flight made us feel comfortable with the plane and flight.  The seats were as comfortable as expected for a low cost airline.  Our cost for the flight was unbelievable ($260 for both of us round trip as well as checking one bag and purchasing seats.)  American was double the price.

Rental car company was closed at 7:30 and no way to pick up rental cars.  In addition, cancelled the return flight causing me to have to find an alternative return.  They didn't cancel and rebook - just cancelled. I'm a million mile a year flier and for convenience, decided to choose this airlines for convenience.

Purchased their bundle add on for seat selection, bag and trip protection.  Easily rescheduled and pushed the trip back a week due to a hurricane hitting on the east coast on my original week.  Very clean during Covid, while some airlines have eased up on cleaning Allegiant has not.  They still Lysol wipe between flights, use hepa air filtration and spray down the planes every 1-2 weeks with a substance that kills viruses for up to 14 days.

131, August 2020,3,Domestic,Economy,Cheap and it's a little obvious.,"I recently flew with this airline to Las Vegas and back. Departure flight on 5/10 was good.Return flight on 5/13 wasn't so good. Plane arrived to terminal late and crew was rushed to make their departure time. As soon as the arriving passengers de-planed, boarding began for our flight. Upon boarding, it was obvious that the plane had not been cleaned and, therefore, not properly sanitized. There were crumbs everywhere and my window had skin grease on it where someone had laid their head against it. A passenger in the row in front of me mentioned something similar saying ""Is this what I have to sit in? I thought they were supposed to clean in between flights?""Normally, I would give the lack of cleanliness a pass. However, because of the current situation with Coronavirus, I cannot turn a blind eye. I know that I personally would have been okay with a flight delay if it meant that the plane would be properly sanitized before I boarded. It's obvious that making scheduled departure windows is more important than the health of passengers.As far as reviewing the airline as a whole, it's okay. I've flown with other budget airlines that offered more to their passengers. Allegiant doesn't offer free wifi on their flights. Not to mention the fact that you don't even get complimentary snack service; you have to pay $3 for an 8oz CAN of soda unless you are a rewards credit card-holder. I'd take an extremely tiny package of pretzels and half a can of a complimentary soda any day over nothing. The seats didn't recline on the planes I flew in and that sucks for a 3 hour or longer flight. TL;DR: if you like low rates and don't care about amenities, this is the airline for you.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA

I added a picture for your reference because que we arrived on the plane our seat were covered in someone else food crumbs. On top that the flight was practically empty, like maybe 35 people and they sat everyone close together. If you really care about our “safety” spread everyone out and make the blatantly young and careless friend of the crew to practice mask rules. Ugh so annoying.

133, August 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,I'll happily pay more to fly with an airline who cares!,"I have been in customer service for over a decade.  I have gone to work after loss, heartbreak, exhaustion, the list goes on and I have never felt that it was acceptable in any way to treat customers the way I was repeatedly treated by Allegiant.  I don't believe in ""the customer is always right,"" but I do believe that when you are representing your place of work that that should be handled with absolute professionalism.  Both Sondra and Teresa, at the Mesa Gateway Airport, were less than willing to even hear out what I was there for before stating ""they didn't handle that"" or ""our office is closed.""  I've gained valuable insight into their companies work culture and unfortunately it reeks of hostility and that if they can get away with not helping, then they won't help.  So disappointed in the lack of humanity behind allegiant after this!My mother flew from Provo to Mesa, where we discovered that her bag did not make it and that there was no one on duty in the airport to help with the matter.  After walking to the ticketing counter, which is accessed from a separate entrance, we were told VERY rudely by the allegiant agents that they ""can't help us""... that's it.  Several phone calls, emails, forms, and online chat later someone called the following day where we had arranged for her bag to be placed behind the ticketing counter where I could pick it up between 1-6pm.I arrive only to be told by the lady at the counter that she knew nothing about the missing bag that was suppose to be there.  I explain the situation to the manager, Teresa, who says she doesn't know anything about a bag and that that is not something they handle.  I explain that that is not the information we were told and they should have the bag specifically behind the ""ticketing counter"" because the baggage office was closed.  She said it's ""unlikely"" and that I need to wait a few minutes while she dealt with something else.I wait patiently for her to come back and then all she asks is for my ""contact information,"" to which I responded ""my contact information for what?"" She proceeded to tell me she would take it down and get back to me later.  I told her that in no way was I leaving until she did some further investigation into the fact that the bag should be there, since I had driven all the way to the airport based on what we were told.  Teresa told me that she didn't deserve to be spoken to like this and that she was done.  I called my mother to see if we could straighten this out when Teresa asked me to step aside rudely so she could help someone else, to which I responded that I wouldn't since I was waiting to talk to someone who could help.  She told me she would be happy to call security to escort me out, to which I asked her name and she refused to give it to me.I tried yet again to explain where my frustration was stemming from, to which she condescendingly told me now that I was speaking more reasonably she would help me, where I wasn't being any different than before.  She then informed that she actually had received a call from BCO that they would be running a bag over for them to hold onto until someone arrived, but no one had. Why someone would either purposefully go out of their way to give poor customer service or not comprehend that I was that person here to pick up the bag is BEYOND me.  Sondra at the BCO office was just as rude when I drove over there to pick up the bag that apparently she was suppose to have dropped off hours earlier but was ""too busy,"" only to tell me they were closed and I could wait as she slowly walked to the restroom with no further explanation.  When she finally returned she also acted like she wasn't sure what I was talking about, even though she was the exact person my mother had talked to twice, before going into the office and getting the bag in question.

I started having concerns the minute our departure flight was delayed an hour for ""maintenance"". We flew to San Diego from Billings for a family vacation. Was dupposed to be a Thursday out Sunday back trip.On Sunday we go to come back and they start to board the plane as we are walking to the plane the pilot comes out telling us we are going to have go back inside. We do and get hit with an hour delay. After the end of the delay they cancell the flight.When they cancell they offer reschedule you on the next flight, or give you a voucher. The next flight was the next Thursday. After a long talk and batering with customer service the agreed book me onto a flight the next day out of Las Vegas.I rented a car and drove to Vegas and spent the night. Using the app checked in had my boarding passes get to the airport get up to security and my passes vanish on the app. I go down stairs to the Allegiant desk where there was one person working and waited in line for almost an hour. About the time I get there I get notified that my flight has departed early. Customer service refused to do anything more then refund my tickets. They told me they are small so they do not have extra planes to rebook flights..I had to book a flight on Southwest out of my own pocket, plus the car, fuel, food, and motel in Vegas. They claim I can submit my receipts but I was told do not expect anything.Customer service was rude and unprofessional. The lady I talked to lied saying I threatened an attorney which I never said. Her ""supervisor"" was even worse. They made it seem like it was an inconvenience to try and talk and help me.They claimed I was yelling which I was not. I have tried reach out to talk to corporate they refuse to help me there now. They claim I already spoke to management at the call center now was talking to customer relations. They will not further escalate the situation. After said they would message the member of corporate I wanted to talk to. Which I didnt get a chance to respond before they ended the online chat.Not to mention the same plane that was delayed in Billings was the one they had to cancel due to mechanical issues. They knew that plane was having an issue.Southwest cut me a good deal and they were so nice. They listened to me complain and could not believe that they would handle the situation like they did. Stick with Southwest, American, United even Frontier is better the Allegaint. They do not care about customers, the stress or financial burden their actions cause.

One flight attendant did not wear mask properly either exposing nose or both nose and mouth, often wearing it below her chin while interacting with passengers. Same attendant removed her mask while preparing beverage cart and talked to another attendant over the cart, thus contaminating the cart with micro droplets from her nose and mouth. Several passengers did not wear masks or did not wear them over mouth and nose. Flight attendants did nothing. They even interacted with those guests and said nothing. Another flight attendant touched her very loose fitting handmade face mask so frequently, then touched commonly used surfaces on seats, door handles, passing drinks, etc - potentially spreading virus from front of her mask to other surfaces and passengers.

My guess is they are more interested in playing tag or chasing butterflies than running the business. ABSOLUTELY EMBARRASSING!!!!  I can give you my story but the fact is pay the extra money and go to an airline that actually takes off and lands to and from the destination you booked...

Maintenance was able to fix the issue after 5 hours. Flight attendants were awesome. If only all Allegiant employees, including executives and those in Contracts, cared as much about customers as the Florida-based flight crew does...We rented a car through Allegiant, who contracts with Alamo. Said contract does not require Alamo to remain open to wait for customers when flights are delayed. So, if your Allegiant flight gets in past midnight, don’t expect to have a car waiting for you. And when you call Allegiant Customer Care for assistance, don’t expect any of that either. We were informed that Allegiant could NOT cancel our car rental (the same one they made for us). Nor could Allegiant guarantee reimbursement to us. We could “try to get reimbursed by going through the website.” When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told that also had to be requested via a website. Customer Care Rep, Brianna, must have very little experience with being stranded at 3AM at an airport with no car and no ride. She was argumentative, interrupting, and clearly unable to empathize with this customer. I counted 6 other people from our flight who were in same predicament.

However, the flight attendants did not repeat this information to the passengers, did not enforce it, and did not abide by it themselves.

155, July 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,Worst Airline and Worst Customer Service Ever!,"If we could give 0 stars, we would.Our first flight from Knoxville to Fort Lauderdale was delayed 30 minutes due to incoming flight delay. Then once on the plane there was another delay of 30-45 minutes for paperwork. Then they announced that there was a missing screw found on flight inspection for one of the exterior panels and they de-boarded the plane to fix it. We were then back waiting in the airport for another hour.Once we finally arrived in our destination, 2 hours later than expected, we had to wait 20+ minutes on the tarmac because our gate was occupied. The flight attendants were helpful in moving us up front so that as soon as we parked we could try to run to our next flight, unfortunately with all the delays we missed our connecting flight from Fort Lauderdale to New Orleans.Once we got off the plane and our next flight had taken off without us, we went to Allegiant’s desk and manager JP was very helpful and instructed us on how to call customer service and what to say. He was also very compassionate. Both the flight attendants and JP shared there was nothing they could do, but assured us that in calling customer service, they would be able to help with our current situation.As one of the top 10 airlines in the US with over 2.6 billion in capital gains, I would think they would be able to take care of us. However, that was clearly not the case, nor their priority to take care of us, and that was definitely what was communicated to us. We called customer service and talked to Danielle. She was horrible. She first made this out to be our fault and shared that when the flight was delayed we should have called, however it was delayed 4 times. We were told multiple times that they do not have the capability to help us. (For the Allegiant employee reading this, I implore you to listen to this 1.5 hour conversation). Being a Knoxville native and having Allegiant as one of our main hubs it’s disappointing and baffling that this is how they would treat their customers not to mention returning customer. They intentionally left us stranded in an airport not willing to do anything about it in the middle of a pandemic.Danielle said there was nothing they could do, that she didn’t have the capability. Then she would put us on hold for a minimum of 5 minutes each time and as long as 15 minutes and come back with nothing. As someone who is in customer service and client care, this hour and a half was the worst display of customer service I have ever experienced in my entire life. I have never felt more helpless, disrespected, and manipulated.Danielle wouldn’t get us a return flight, or put us in a hotel in the middle of a pandemic when it was their fault we were stranded. Finally, Danielle offered to book us a return flight for 24 hours later, but shared we would still have to pay for the return flight, and still insisted that they wouldn’t get us a hotel.Finally Danielle shared that she could change our original return flight to be the flight mentioned above (24 hours later) she took our email and said she booked the flight, and then hung up on us, and never registered us for the flight or sent us the flight info.At the end of our conversation, Danielle was not apologetic and she was frustrated that I was frustrated that there was absolutely nothing being done to accommodate this awful experience, and then unapologetically hung up on me. When I asked her, “Are you really hanging up on me right now?” she replied, “I told you there is nothing we can do so I’m going to have to leave it at that,” she then thanked me for flying Allegiant, said, “I hope you have a good rest of your evening,” and then she hung up on me.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA

159, July 2020,5,Domestic,Basic Economy,Still my hometown favorite after all these years ✈️,"Allegiant has NEVER done me wrong. The people at the ticket counter are often working the gate as well, it’s true, but the passengers on here expecting First Class Executive Club Service while paying rock bottom airfare ticket prices are just whiney self-absorbed Karens. A couple of pro tips to make your trip go smoothly: First: download the app and check in or buy your bags all online before you get to the airport. Online check-in closes an hour before departure, so just turn on your app notifications. Screen shot your boarding pass/es. Done. Second: your ticket was inexpensive for two reasons 1. Allegiant doesn’t fly to major airports so check your itinerary/ticket and map it. Especially if you’re going to Phoenix or Orlando. 2. they don’t fly several times a day to the same place, in fact, they don’t even fly the routes every day so plan ahead. Third: once they sell out of a certain price tier, the tickets get more expensive. As soon as the clock hits midnight PST, all flights less than a week out automatically go up. It’s a business, not a charity. Again, plan ahead. Fourth: Save you & your travel companion’s preferences and information in a profile on their website. It not only makes booking a snap, it assures that you don’t forget something in a rush. On that note, book your carry-on and checked baggage during the reservation process, it’s much cheaper.I recently missed a flight due to several unforeseen events and the agents in person and on the phone could not have been more kind. They did not have to help me, but, the gate closed early and I was still in security so I got left. Allegiant went the extra mile to make it right and to get me on another flight the next day to a different city that was equal distance to my destination. Of course, I wasn’t yelling/swearing at them or making demands - so maybe it’s true what my grandma always said...you catch a lot more flies (& flights) with honey than you do vinegar. Thanks for getting me home safe, Allegiant. You’re always my number 1 pick!",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
160, July 2020,1,Domestic,Basic Economy,HORRIBLE Filthy Flight,"IF you BELIEVE EVERYTHING Allegiant is ""PROMISING"" during this Covid-19 pandemic...DON'T!!! The plane was filthy and there was food, dirty fingerprints all over our seats, the arm rests and the floor!!! We brought this to the 2 attendant's attention and they basically BARKED ""We don't have time to clean or sanitize between flights!!!"" NOT to mention...NO Safety Packets WERE WERE PROMISED with masks, gloves and wipes!!We KNOW things are tough for ALL OF USE because of this pandemic, but BASIC cleaning SHOULD BE PERFORMED BETWEEN FLIGHTS TO HELP ENSURE OUR SAFETY!!! NOT to mention that NEITHER Attendant ever washed OR sanitized their hands. One did place a pair of gloves on-BUT-she kept touching her hair, her face, nose and then started to serve FOOD AND DRINKS WITHOUT washing or sanitizing!! Obviously NO CARING ABOUT CUSTOMER'S NEEDS OR HEALTH!!!Additionally, we were scheduled to begin boarding at 12:13 p.m. However, they started to board almost an HOUR before the scheduled time, yet we departed LATER than scheduled. When we asked if we HAD to board then, we were told that IF we didn't board immediately we would have to pay for another ticket if they decided to depart early...WHAT?!? Therefore, in OUR opinion and that of surrounding passengers who openly expressed their frustrations, THERE WAS AMPLE TIME TO CLEAN AND DISINFECT THE PLANE vs. us HAVING to sit and wait on the plane for close to 2 hours!!! UNACCEPTABLE AND SHAMEFUL OF ALLEGIANT TO EXPOSE ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS TO POTENTIAL AND PROBABLE DANGERS OF THIS PANDEMIC!!!",Allegiant,low-cost,USA

Beginning with the gate attendant who called for boarding groups every 1 minute and 15 seconds...stacking up passengers in the gateway without any social distancing.,....Although they were told...they continued to do so!ON BOARD...although the stewardesses had masks....they were trapped around their necks providing little to no protection to the passengers...(did not cover the nose /mouth).THE FLIGHT....as ususal..it did NOT depart on time, although ALL passengers were in their seats prior to the departure time.AFTER LANDING...it became a free for all with Allegiant making no effort to communicate with the passenger on proper protocol for deplaning.BAGGAGE...was a disaster...everyone waited a full 45 minutes for their baggage to arrive...unfortunately, when it arrived it was grouped with another Allegiant flight that landed AFTER our flight!SUMMARY...the RISK OUT WEIGHS ANY BENEFIT (particularly when you consider the nickel and dimming from Allegiant)....Moreover, in considering all other aspects....your satisfaction and experience would be much greater with any other airline.

168, July 2020,2,Domestic,Economy,"Expectations met, but not on Coronavirus Safety","So, I would probably have given Allegiant 4 stars. The ticketing process was easy and straightforward, as was boarding. The flight attendants were all pleasant, and the flight itself was smooth. The seats don't recline and your tray table is small, and you have to pay extra for everything, but this is to be expected from a low cost airline. My only concerns deal with their lack of concerns with the coronavirus. Both of my flights were at least 90% full, so there certainly was no social distancing. On top of that, travelers were not required to wear masks, and only about 25% on board my flight did. While kitsch that included a mask, gloves, and wipes were available, they certainly weren't advertising or recommending that people take them, I specifically had to ask for one.  My flights were in and out of Florida, a state that has seen a spike in cases, yet no real precautions were taken. I will probalby use them again in the future, but certainly not until the pandemic passes and cases are going down.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
169, July 2020,3,Domestic,Economy,make sure you check in early,They refused to let us check in and board the plane despite being at ticket counter within the acceptable 45 minutes window.

The next day, another staff member said it was still sitting in the original airport, yet I did not qualify for overnighted shipping anymore? I explained to all of them how essential it was for me to get this bag. I have a wedding this weekend, not to mention lots of important medications and other items in that bag.

You will receive several emails before your flight outlining Allegiant’s response to coronavirus and the requirements for boarding.  You will be told they require you to wear a mask, wash your hands before boarding, and you will receive a safety kit with mask, hand sanitizer wipes, and gloves at the gate prior to boarding.2. You get to the gate and no one is reminding passengers to wash their hands before boarding.3. No safety kits are available.4. Upon boarding the flight attendant who is greeting passengers is not wearing a mask.5. Most passengers are crammed into the back of the plane 3 to a row, packed in like sardines.6. During the flight they do not require masks to stay on.7. All flight attendants now have been trained to be belligerent, rude, taking names of anyone who questions them, and threatens to throw people off the plane for complaining about the cramped full seats and no attempt at social distancing.8.

Lauderdale, I was seated in emergency row, great lots of leg room. On the flight back I was seated in non emergency there seemed to be almost as much leg room as the emergency rows, I had plenty of leg room (I am 6 ft and about 250 lbs), another plus in my opinion is seats don'd recline so you don't have the person in front of you in your lap. I arrived at my destination pretty relaxed as I had plenty of room to stretch out. Other airlines cram you in like sardines with out much room to move. Flight crew was great, very polite and helpful. Check in was smooth. Absolutely no problems from check in to baggage claim. The ample seat space more than makes up for the lack of WiFi on the aircraft.

We had to have all our bags fall under one person's benefit. Meaning we each had a carry on coming to FL, going back, my carry on had to be checked in. And this flight will have hardly anyone because if CoVid. As typical, Allegiant sucks in many ways. But I've tolerated all their ridiculousness. This was yet another disappointment. They are bottom of the barrel. And change all the rules, even when it is writing. I thought after all these years that they would have it figured out. But they have no common sense and care about no one as usual. The only consistent thing is they are a terrible airline with no common sense.

176, July 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,Purchased a ticket for my elderly mother and tried to purchase her a seat away from others due to covid and her lowered,"My mother had a horrible experience yesterday flying from Bozeman to Nashville  on a flight I purchased for her (7/5 from Bozeman to Nashville on flight 2871). She has Crohns disease and COPD and is immunodeficient and was moving to where I live so I can provide and care for her, as she was all alone in Montana following the death of my father.  I specifically purchased the flight on Allegiant so she would have nonstop service and reduce her risk of exposure to Covid-19.  When I booked the ticket, I was sure to request wheelchair assistance and indicate that she needed her POC oxygen.  I also inquired with Allegiant in advance to be sure that I had everything correct in terms of her POC.Although I had paid to select her seat in advance, several days prior to the trip when I tried to check her in online I decided to view the seat chart to find her a seat that was as far away from other passengers as was possible.  There was an entire empty row in row 3 at the bulkhead, so I paid extra to again change her seat to that row.  Her nurse drove her to the airport, checked her in, and all seemed fine.  Until she got on the plane.  She went to her row as planned, but the flight attendants told her that she could not sit there with her oxygen.  She did not understand why—especially when all of the seats in that row were empty.  They told her she had to move back to row 8.  That row had other passengers in it.  She was also told she could not use her oxygen there and they instead made her stow it above and she was unable to use it for the trip.  She was also forced to sit next to others.  When the flight ended, none of the flight attendances would help her get her oxygen unit down, even though they knew it was heavy and that she needed assistance.  Indeed, the only person who came to her help was actually the Captain, who seemed quite surprised at the manner in which she had been treated.  Her oxygen unit was capable of being taken off its wheel base and absolutely could have been used in the front row, which I had purchased for her for that reason.  Mom texted me right before airplane mode was invoked and told me what was happening.  I tried to call the airline immediately and was placed on hold and nobody ever answered.  I also sent seven messages on Facebook messenger since the voice recording on the phone said I could reach an attendance 7 days a week on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.  That was untrue.  I never got any response to my urgent messages. Because of the manner in which my Mom was treated, her life was placed in danger.  She was not permitted to use her oxygen on board and was not permitted to sit in the safe seat I paid for in order ot reduce her risk of Covid exposure in her fragile state.  This is horrendous.  To make matters worse, nobody would come to her aid when she needed help.  I cannot imagine that any airline would treat an elderly, immune-compromised widow in this manner.  I have contacted the airline multiple times and have received no meaningful response.",Allegiant,low-cost,USA
177, July 2020,2,Domestic,Economy,Never ever again,"We flew from Portsmouth NH to Punta Gorda Florida on Monday June 29th. Our flight was delayed for one hour due to weather as reported by an Allegiant employee. As the hour delay neared its end, a second delay was announced, this time 3 additional hours. The plane was diverted to Syracuse NY to refuel and again weather is causing this delay. (Weather radar on my phone app showed no weather in either NH or Syracuse). I have a friend on the delayed plane who texted me that there was a medical emergency on his flight and they were diverted to NJ. He was returning from Punta Gorda to Portsmouth. 4 hours later we are enroute to Punta Gorda, in-flight staff is great, pleasant, and professional. No issues in flight.07.06.20: Time to return home. We have a 6:36am flight out of Punta Gorda. At 5:05 am (car loaded, luggage kids, etc). We receive a text from Allegiant, flight delayed until 9:00 am......9:00 am on 07.07.20What? a 26 hour delay? Our rental is already committed to someone else, so, we have no flight, no place to stay, and Allegiants customer service opens at 7:00 am CST.We ended up buying tickets with JetBlue out of Tampa to Boston for 6 people at a cost of $1300.00, had to pay an extra charge for the rental car as we returned it to Tampa instead of Punta Gorda ($306.00), then had to hire a car service to drive us from Boston, to our car, which was parked at the Portsmouth NH airport ($175.00 plus tip).Oh Allegiant says they are sorry for the inconvienence and will refund the unused portion of our tickets in the form of a voucher.The return trip delay had nothing to do with weather. It was an operational decision to send the plane to another location as they could make more money somewhere else. Unfortunately it ended up costing me and my family.Thanks Allegiant (double middle finger emoji)!!!!!",Allegiant,low-cost,USA

179, July 2020,1,Domestic,Economy,NEVER FLY THIS AIRLINE TO AND FROM OAK-VEGAS,"Decided on a last minute quick trip to Las Vegas for the weekend. It’s such a short flight I went cheap on Allegiant. Big mistake ! The plane and crew were great. It was the passengers that were the problem. Going wasn’t too bad except for my seat mate blasting music and another passenger smoking weed on the plane 😳. I figured ok it’s only an hour I can manage. Coming home today from Vegas to Oakland was a whole different story. We boarded and after a  25 minute delay with 3 women sitting 2 rows behind me using the loudest most foul language, we were told we had to change planes( mechanical issues)  No problem. The women stood up starting to yell profanities at the crew and pilot. Pushed me out of the way as I retrieved my bag from the overhead compartment and told me to move out of her way. I was in 1st row. We were told we had 45 minutes to wait( again I get it because I travel a lot ) I’ve never seen or heard more yelling and profanities from passengers in my life. I’ve traveled all over the world and delays happen. Who wants to fly on a plane with mechanical issues. The staff at the gate had absolutely no control of the irate passengers and ended up calling Las Vegas PD for help with one passenger that was not allowed back on the flight. I complained about the loud women on the plane that pushed me out of the way and was told her and her 2 friends would not be allowed back on the flight. Well to my surprise they were not only let on the plane sitting one row behind me but we’re told I complained about them. I just ignored them and put my headphones in. The trouble started when the plane landed. We weren’t even parked before passengers including the loud women were up and out of there seats. The poor flight attendants had to yell to sit down. One man blocked me in my 1st row seat and wouldn’t move so I could get to my overhead bag and pushed me. Then the trouble started. The loud women started yelling at me that I was blocking the way out and accused me of having the belligerent man that wasn’t allowed back on the plane thrown out. At this point all the passengers were pushing and shoving to leave the plane. Then “Black lives matter” stared to be yelled and all eyes were on me. The 2 flight attendants asked the captain to get the police involved he seemed more irritated than concerned that I had at least 10 passengers yelling at me calling me every name in book. I was threatened and scared to death. Again the 2 crew members were great and stood in front of me to protect me from the angry passengers until the police arrived to escort me off the plane and to my car. What a nightmare!!The flight attendants told me that those particular flight oak-las and Stockton-las always have issues with passengers.

Well its getting close to 20min then finally bus show's up. i go to itinerary desk, they refuse to print my itinerary cause I was not there 1 hour before take off (still had 10 min till they close the gate) I argued with them that i should have no problem getting to the gate since this airline is super small, and there was no line for security. They still refused and did not have any other flight going out to near bye destination. Then i could not exit the economy parking as their credit/debit pay machine greedily took my debit card and would not return it. I had to wait another 10 min for someone to come fetch my debit card.
