"<h2 class=""text_header"">""They have never been on time""</h2>", |  AWA needs to be held accountable for their bad service. They have never been on time ever in all the times that I have flown on their planes. The planes are small and old and dirty and staffs are rude and arrogant. It is normal for your flight to be two or three hours delayed every time. But if you come even one minute late for checking in they will sell your seat to another person and make you buy it again. During the flight they used to give sandwiches and pastries and juices but now only water is given for flights of almost one hour. Also during the Covid times they are not maintaining any social distancing on the plane.
