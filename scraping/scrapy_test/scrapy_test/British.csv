1,Yesterday,1,Europe,Economy,4 flights canceled in 1 month !,I have 4 flights cancelled in 1 month with BA and the vouchers they conversing the payments are not useful again due to numerous cancellations ! Just stopped  book flights with this company!
2,Yesterday,1,International,Premium Economy,Don't get fooled into a voucher,"This will soon be a class action suit. They talk you into a voucher and then oh sorry, we can't possibly help you anymore. I love Scotland but British Airways is a terrible business that basically will steal your money."
3,Yesterday,3,International,Premium Economy,Ok service,I have been flying British Airway for decades. Overall the service is fine. The food pre-covid was ok but nothing great by airline standards.  If they lose your bag or damage it they will never compensate you. The whole baggage claim process is a total waste of time. Nothing is covered. If you fly a lot you should know to always take a cabin bag and not checked in luggage. Never check in baggage with valuables of any sort because they do not give an F.…
4,Feb 9,1,International,Economy,Money mongers,"Was not allowed to board the flight for highly unreasonable reason that I don’t have a Canadian passport while I have a valid visa and I travelled from Toronto to Mumbai using BA, which should be suffice. But when pushed them to show where have you mentioned on the e-ticket or on your website, they refused to show and promised to refund. Now, I am left chasing these thugs with no reply for about a month. Guess the hard earned money is gone, why? coz BA wanted to simply cancel tickets keep the money and make people buy the same ticket at unimaginable high prices. They are highly unethical and making use of every chance to collect more money in the name of pandemic. They are a sham. Disgraceful company and management.…"

7,Feb 5,1,International,Business Class,Cancelled my flights when other airlines were still flying,"Last minute cancellation and left to my own devices. Absolute disgusting. After flying this route for the past 25 years. BA did not cancel my flight once. Cancelled 3 times. Yes, I guess the covid issue did not help but other airlines were still flying this route and even…"
8,Feb 3,1,International,Economy,Lied regarding my refund.,"British Airways canceled my flight reservation due to Covid, and promised me that I would receive a refund of €550 within 2 months. After 7 months and no refund British customer service prompted me to contact OPOMO for my refund instead. OPOMO is a complete scum that will…"
9,Feb 2,1,International,First Class,Worst airway EVER,"Worst customer services, they were SUPER rude and literally they are stealing money from customers. Lack of communication, lack of customer services and lack of empathy. I never write reviews but with this company I will do it in all pages I can find."
